This was a group project written for Professor Rodion Podorozhny.
The goal of this project was to create an interactive simulator
where a player could play blackjack, with varying degrees of difficulty.

The players interacted with a rule-based dealer AI to make choices
that would ultimately lead to either their victory or defeat.
